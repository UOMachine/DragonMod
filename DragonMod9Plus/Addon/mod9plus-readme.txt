Ryandor's Dragon Mod version 9 Plus (9.1)
1 July 2003

This is an add-on for Mod 9 (required). To install, extract to your Dragon
folder making sure you use folder names. It will create some new files and overwrite changed files. Make
sure you back up your Dragon folder if you have custom files. This is
completely compatible with maps made with mod 9.

What's included:

Color:			roughgrass
Transition:		roughgrass
Item transition:	rock2- / star2-
Item placement:		roughgrass
Item placement:		swamp
Item placement: 	prairie and plains

---

About the Roughgrass:
This color is for creating "true" OSI swamps. It's used for placing a rough
looking (hence the name) grass around swamp. Included are the item placement
files (including an enhanced swamp). Thanks goes out to StormCrow for
creating this. 

About the rock2- and star2-
This was by request from Imprint. This will create a coastline like the Malas
map. Bascially a rock border between the land and starfield. This currently
covers grass, grassbump, roughgrass, dirt, snow, sand, jungle
and mountain (mountain looks bad though).

About prairie and plains: By request as well, from Galavorn, these are test
scripts for replacing grass and desert item placements. They are commented 
out for now in the items.txt file. If you use them you MUST either comment
out the grass and desert lines or make sure the areas they cover do not
overlap. These need to be adjusted for your taste. Consider these starter
scripts to play with.
