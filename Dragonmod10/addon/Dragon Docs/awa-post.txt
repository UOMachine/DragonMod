- cave to water is not necessary because all X2Water is not map0.mul inserted, X2Water is allways covered with static shore tiles. at the other hand, u can make yourself a cave2water between translation, so learn how to trick. for me i.e. i sometimes use same terrain tiles at same altitude but with different hexcode inside the bmp file only for creating some special effekts for the between convertion. nearly same usage i.e. for grass which some grass i want to have uneven and some i want to have plain. I never use the rectancle unevenly feature, i only paint it with different colors because mostly i did not have rectancles. This is also important for the static placements. so put your special i.e. grass colors outside of the grass group to avoid placing statics on them (or completely different statics :) ) Can u follow me?

this is hardcoded and i dunno if this is allready fixed or fixed in the future. I wrote a perlscript which is scanning the map0.mul and writes new shore statics.

I heard that you emailed AwA asking about aspects of Dragon and the mod 9 for Dragon. Since I am the creator of the mod 9 I wanted to ask you about the bugs you possibly found. I also have a way to help prevent "patterning" in the map. If you could reply back, or contact me on ICQ 2006722 (I'm always invisible so make sure to leave a message) or you can post a mesage on my forums at www.ryandor.com
