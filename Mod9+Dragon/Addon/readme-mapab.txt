Ryandor's Map Action and Brushes for Photoshop 5.5/6.0

July 18, 2002

What's included:
mapactions.atn		The template I use to create new maps
mapbrushes.abr		The brushes I use for map making
readme-mapab.txt	This file

----
Note: These do not work with Photoshop 4.0. Not sure if it works with 5.0.

Installation:
Copy them anywhere you like, but I recommend in /dragon/addon folder
They will not get lost there and once installed you never have to look at them
again (unless I change them and you want to update them).

Open Photoshop.
For Photoshop 5.5 do this:

Menu: Window -> Show Brushes (if not already showing)
Menu: Window -> Show Actions (if not already showing)
To load the brushes, right click the "right arrow" in line with the "brush tab" and select "Load
Brushes". Browse to the /dragon/addon directory to find the mapbrushes.abr file, select it, then 
load it. If you get a bunch of duplicates (and you don't mind lossing any brushes you've
created) then do it again except select "Replace Brushes".
To load the actions, right click the "right arrow" in line with the "action" tab and select "Load Actions".
Browse to the /dragon/addon directory and select it and load it.

For Photoshop 6.0:
I know it's a bit different to get to the Brushes and Action Tabs, but once there, it's the same right
click the right arrow thing. Can someone fill this in for me so I can include it?

To use the Actions, just highlight the action you want to use, and hit the "play" button on the bottom
of the Action window. Photoshop will do it's thing and you'll have a map template set up with water and
dungeon areas ready to be painted.

How to use the actions:
In the Actions window, hit the "play" button on the bottom.
Use "Map Template (Dragon 1.03.62)" for creating a map using the original color table that comes with Dragon.
Use "Map Template (Ry mod 9)" for creating a color table for use with my mod 9.
Use "Upgrade mod 8 to mod 9" to upgrade a previously made map that uses mod 8.
Use "Set Ocean and Dungeon areas" for prefilling the the bmp with water -5 and black in the standard areas.
"Contract 1" (shortcut key F2) is for contracting, by one pixel, a selection that is made with the Markee, Lasso, and Magic Wand Tools.
"Expand 1" (shortcut key F3) is for expanding, by one pixel, a selection that is made with the Markee, Lasso, and Magic Wand Tools.
See my map making tutorial for for info on where you can use these.
